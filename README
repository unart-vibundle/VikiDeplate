QUICKSTART
This plugin adds wiki-like hypertext capabilities to Vim. You can use viki as a "minor" mode (i.e., as an add-on to any other mode) or as a full-fledged wiki mode. There is also an add-on plugin for "wikifying" latex documents by turning some latex commands into wiki names. If viki is properly configured, activating a reference to an image, a webpage etc. will view that resource in an external viewer.

From http://sourceforge.net/projects/deplate/ you can download a ruby based tool to convert viki markup to html, latex, or docbook. On its homepage (http://deplate.sf.net) you can read a more detailled specification of the markup.


MINOR WIKI MODE:
Use the hypertext facility with any filetype. Just type :VikiMinorMode and all wiki names and URLs will be highlighted.


FULL WIKI MODE:
In full mode, viki becomes a personal wiki (http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PersonalWiki) -- some sort of lo-fi database of notes and all sorts of information. Set 'filetype' to viki. The full wiki mode is like the minor mode but with folding support, syntax highlighting (for headings, lists, tables, textstyles etc.), and additional key bindings (i.e., you can press <c-tab> or <s-c-tab> to move the cursor to the next/previous viki name). You can bind viki mode to some file extension by adding a line like the following to some configuration file (see :help ftdetect or so):

    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.viki set ft=viki


WIKIS:
In case you missed out on wikis, a wiki is a simple way of creating hypertexts. In its very basic form creating a hyperlink is as easy as writing a word in CamelCase or by enclosing a word in brackets--as in [[destination]] or [-destination-]. URLs are automatically recognized as hyperlinks. You usually begin with creating a directory where your wiki files should go to and by creating a wiki index--a master file that contains references to sub-pages. After a while you end up with many small, tightly interlinked files/notes. There is also some basic support for basic markup like emphasized text, headings and the like. In the case of Viki/deplate, this markup would compare to, e.g., LaTeX markup as follows:

    LaTeX: \section{Title}
    Viki:  * Title

    LaTeX: \emph{text}
    Viki:  __text__
